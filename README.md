<ol>
    <li><a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#" target="_blank">requests</a></li>
        <code>requests</code> library will allow us to get access through websites.
    <li><a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installing-beautiful-soup" target="_blank">Beautiful Soup</a></li>
        <code>Beautiful Soup</code> library gives us a HTML based code lines based on the websites that we have given. This will allow us to find specific tags and classes that we want in order to scrap the data we want. By using <code>requests</code>, we can get through websites then we can extract information.

        <code>Selenium</code> is a library that automates browsers so that way the browsers we are about to extract data cannot identify the program we are about to use as a bot. <br>
        <b>NOTE:</b> The following program is for educational purpose. I have no intention of using the program for commercial purposes.
